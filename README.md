# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Generation using GANs

This project implements a basic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) from scratch using PyTorch to generate handwritten digits based on the MNIST dataset.

## 🧪 Overview
- Implemented custom **Generator** and **Discriminator** networks
- Trained the GAN model to generate images of digits (0–9) from random noise
- Visualized training progress using image grids at different epochs

## 🔄 Current Status
- The current version (**v1.1**) shows early results with partially recognizable digits
- Actively working on:
  - Improving output sharpness
  - Stabilizing training
  - Exploring architecture enhancements (DCGAN, Dropout, etc.)

## 🔍 Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 📸 Sample Output
> Generated Digits (as of v1.1)

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Use of DCGAN architecture
- Add training history tracking
- Deploy output visualizations via Streamlit or Flask
